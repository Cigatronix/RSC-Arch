# Roblox Server-Client Architecture
This was an introductory project for me to become familiar with roblox-ts (Roblox TypeScript).

While this will work in games, it **shouldn't** be, as it's outdated, hence why the repository is archived and read-only.

I will release a new "RSC Arch" project in the near future that's much more up to date, and includes structure for the new react library that was ported to roblox-js. It'll prove much more useful to newer developers looking to integrate roblox-ts in their projects with rodux for data state management.
